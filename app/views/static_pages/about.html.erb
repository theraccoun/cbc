<div class="well span5"> <h3> What is Concept Before Code?</h3>
        <p> Often when we are first learning new algorithms we are bombarded by a great deal of text and psuedocode. When I learn new algorithms, I usually bust out a sheet of paper and begin drawing how the data is getting transformed as the algorithm proceeds.

Concept before code is a tool I built so that people who want to test their conceptual knowledge of various algorithms can do so by using a visual, interactive, simulated representation of how the data is transformed as you iterate through the algorithm. This should improve the learning and understanding of the algorithm! </p>
